 * Do a "manual persistence" version of the multi-process web demo

 * Refactor the demos  to a final state - rename  files to be simpler,
   remove old crap code, move XML / HTML files in to sub-directories.

 * Review and add API support for Amqp transactions.

 * Add support for  sending multiple Amqp messages in  a single "write
   session".  May be best to use a "send stack"

 * Alter the build sequence to refuse  to build in cases where a class
   and  method  field  name   clashes.   This  should  mean  that  the
   simplified field handling in the wire\Method class is safe.
