			    AMQPHP Notes.
			     ------------

Robin Harvey, 2011


This is  a pure PHP implementation  of the amqp  0.9.1 protocol.  This
version has been tested against RabbitMQ 2+.  Please note that PHP5.3+
is  required, and some  of the  test scripts  use pcntl  functions and
forking.

			   Getting Started.
			   ----------------

First you need  to generate the Amqp protocol  bindings, there's a PHP
script  to  do  this  in  the 'tools'  subdirectory,  simple  run  the
generate-bindings.php  script  and  copy  the generated  code  to  the
correct location.

 * cd tools/
 * php generate-bindings.php
 * mv gencode ../

You should now  be able to run  one of the test scripts,  from the CLI
it's probably  best to run  tests/forker.php - you can  manipulate the
RabbitMQ connection parameters and  the number of proucers / consumers
in the INI file.  Enjoy!


			  Running the tests.
			  ------------------

The tests scripts to run demos are:

 * tests/forker.php
 * tests/BasicTest.php

The former can be run stand-alone from the CLI - this will use the PHP
pcntl  functions   to  fork  off  producer   and  consumer  processes.
BasicTest.php is a PHPUnit test  class and can be run through PHPUnit.
The INI files specify  RMQ connection parameters and other interesting
run time values.

The  forker.php script  requires a  large data  file to  be  placed in
tests/data/large-file.txt -  this is  used to generate  randomly sized
(potentially very large)  messages.  This file should be  at least 4KB
in size.
